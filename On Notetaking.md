There are about 8 billion perspectives on earth, and there could probably be a specific notetaking system for each and every one person on earth. However I have a few strong opinions on notes that I think you should at least consider; so here goes.

# On Notetaking

You are probably using notes wrong. rre you writing a bunch of information off a PowerPoint your half-genius professor chucked together the night before? Straight into a paper notebook? I’d be very surprised that process is particularly helpful. Honestly I think you’re wasting your time. You might, if you’re lucky, you’ll jot down an important sentence here or there; but once you’ve got these down it’ll take a lot of work to find them again. This is terrible and I’m sorry teachers often gospelize this type of notetaking, it’s by all current measures not a good use of time. As of writing this there is even some evidence showing that you learn *less* by writing things down during class in this way. 

I want to say this: writing notes are *not* a necessary. Truly not. You can probably become a world leader through highlighting documents, jotting down comments on the side and just writing things straight into whatever document you’re working on. But, I do think notetaking can be incredibly useful.

Why? You see, we’re all cursed with soft neuron sponges in our heads that are terribly bad at doing one of its main tasks, remembering stuff. – It shouldn’t really come as a shock to anyone who has walked through a door and suddenly forgotten whatever they were supposed to do. So what do we do with the information that we won’t remember? We write it down.

## On the rules of good notetaking
Here are my 10 commandments:
1. You should easily be able to find any note you’ve written, preferably within seconds
2. You should only need to write something down once.
3. What is in your note should make it **quick** *and* **easy** to regain the information.
4. It should be incredibly easy to start writing a note. 
5. Writing a note should be as easy.
6. You should be able to write, draw and paste images into your notes. (And if you do math, write math)
7. You should be able to share your notes with others.
8. You should be able to take a note anywhere and any time
9. Your notes should be an extension of *your* thoughts, you shouldn’t just copy down whatever somebody else says.
10. Producing good results, not notes, is your primary concern.

What some of you book-jockeys are probably snickering about is how some of these are anti handwriting and “you remember it better if you write it down with a pen” … If you are writing something down to remember it later, without the note, then you’re not writing notes for a good reasons.

**Notetaking, in my book, should help you reach whatever your objective is.** For me it’s writing; posts like this, scientific writing, essays and so on. For you, especially if you are a newer student it’ll probably be to work towards your exams or writing tasks. Whatever your goal is you should start with the goal and work backwards towards what you need your system to do. This is an exercise you might want to do every so often, as your goals evolve so should your notetaking systems.

## On what to do during lectures
So what do I suggest that you do during lectures? Should you just sit there as a passive sponge; hopefully retaining some of the information. No. Well sometimes. But I think there are some things you can do during lectures that will help you get the most out of them. 

If you’re so lucky that your professor is sharing their PowerPoints before or at beginning of class I suggest that you take notes straight on to the lecture. If you have to work with paper you could print it out and just write and highlight onto the page; however I think recreating this process on a computer or tablet is more productive. Personally I’ve had great success doing this. Before or during the first minute of class I’d downloading the PowerPoint (usually as a PDF) to either my computer or my iPad, and then as the teacher is presenting I’d: 

- Highlight the most important points
- Highlight anything that I found particularly difficult
- Write down any useful information the teacher says during the lecture
- Write down any questions I had for the teacher 
- Write down both the Q/A to what other students bring up

This is ordered by frequency for me, I’ll probably only “write” every 10-15 slides, however you might feel the need to do so more frequently. This worked for close to all of my classes. This new highlighted PowerPoint would be where my work for the class would start. These highlights make it very easy to make flashcards or other study tools. However, in the rare case where the teacher did not use a PowerPoint I had this strategy:

- Write down the topics discussed
- Record what the teacher is saying (covertly on my iPad), if it was a particularly technical topic 
- Do a Brain-dump at the end of class\*.

Now this last point is actually a really good tool; Brain-dumping. 
A Brain-dump is basically just sitting down and writing down whatever you remember; usually this only takes around 5-10 minutes for a 2 hour lecture. *”But!”* you might say how could you in 5-10 minutes write down what was the important parts of the lecture. Mainly for two reasons: 
A) Your writing does *not* need to be beautiful nor well written at this point. Just dump whatever comes out of your brain out onto the page.
B) *Talking takes a lot of time*. It’s generally a very unconcise way to present information. However it’s an amazing tool as it’s at a really good pace for learning information, and it’s interactive. 

There is also another thing that comes into effect: filtration. You’re way more likely to remember the important bits of the lecture. This makes the Brain-dump a really great place to start the rest of your work from, just like the highlighted PowerPoint, however you might find that you want to rework the Brain-dump into a more well written and/or accurate document by looking up the topic in other texts.

*\* I do suggest that, if you have the time, you make doing a Brain-dump after class a habit, no matter the type of class. Repeating what was said in class is a great head start on [spaced repetition](https://github.com/Taakefyrsten/Einar-s-Resource-Blog/blob/main/How%20to%20study%20efficiently.md#2-active-recall).*
