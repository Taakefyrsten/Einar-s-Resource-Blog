# How to use large language models for your work

If you want to be at the top of your productive peak I think LLMs (Large Language Models) like Chat GPT and Bing AI might need to be part of your workflow. Knowing when to use them and when to not is really what can make or break your end product these days.

Personally I use LLMs every time I write. I often struggle with recalling a specific word but remember a ton of synonyms. So I’ll go to an LLM and ask “What is 10 synonyms for X, but with more Y feeling”. This frequently gives me the exact word I’m looking for.

Furthermore for coders I really recommend GitHub Copilot. Asking it to correct simple 

## Specific tools

For a great list of resources that is somewhat frequently updated take a look at [Texas A&M University Libraries post](https://tamu.libguides.com/c.php?g=1289555). To me it’s been a great tool to ignore the chaff of terrible LLM-tools and just go use the good ones. Here’s to you TAMU 🍻.

I also suggest [goblin.tools](https://goblin.tools/), it’s a small group of tools that help people who are struggling with certain common mental blocks. One of it’s key features is breaking down a larger project into bite sized pieces dependent on how much you need it broken down. Let’s say you need to clean your apartment. It’ll take this large task and brake it down into items like “Throw all trash into a bag”, “Clean kitchen cooktop” or “Vacuum the carpet”. If you struggle with decision fatigue this can make things a little easier.

As the LLM world is just exploding with new tools I cannot really mention any without there being a better alternative or my recommendation being gone by the end of the week. So if you want to further explore the growing field of LLMs there is the website [“There is an Ai for that“](https://theresanaiforthat.com/most-saved/). Here people can share AI-solutions and review/like/save them.
