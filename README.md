# Einar’s Resource Hub
Welcome! Due to popular demand I’ve put together a page on what resources I recommend for studying, computer work and so on.

## [The R-club R-repository](https://github.com/Taakefyrsten/NMBU-R-club)
For anyone looking for R-resources the R-club R-repository is currently where I and the rest of the R-club have pooled our resources. It will be slowly updated as we have time and figure out how we should extend it. 
## [Computer Tools](https://github.com/Taakefyrsten/Einar-s-Resource-Blog/blob/main/Computer%20Tools.md)
Here I share a few of the tools I recommend when working with computers.

## [How to study efficiently](https://github.com/Taakefyrsten/Einar-s-Resource-Blog/blob/main/How%20to%20study%20efficiently.md)

## [On Notetaking](https://github.com/Taakefyrsten/Einar-s-Resource-Blog/blob/main/README.md)

## [How to use large language models for your work](https://github.com/Taakefyrsten/Einar-s-Resource-Blog/blob/main/How%20to%20use%20large%20language%20models%20for%20your%20work.md)
