# How to study efficiently
To be a good student is *not* to be the student spending the most amount of time on studying. Looking beyond being a kind and social person who is active in class, being a good student is about getting the most out of your courses. You should be gaining skills and learning useful information, and you should try to do your best on your assesments. I hope that with this guide you'll not only do better on your exams and so on, but that you'll have more time to do the things in life that matter, besides school.

## Common pitfalls:
Let's start here, by removing common mistakes that might be holding you back.
### On ‚ÄúLearning styles‚Äù
**There is no evidence that learning styles exist.** After several  decades of studies there are stil no evidence for learning styles. It‚Äôs been the consensus since 2006, almost 20 years. I‚Äôm sorry people have been wasting your time with it. It does not make it easier to learn and remember things, *actually* it just pigeonholes and handicaps the students who focus on it. You‚Äôll always end up with a worse study technique. If you focus on good study techniques will you not only learn and remember way more, but you'll spend less time doing so. Again a perfect student spends just the right amount of time on studying, and spends the rest of their time partying, resting and living good lives.

### On remembering vs recognizing
The most common way to burn yourself while repeating information is the pitfall between memory and recognition. When you are presented with information you‚Äôve previously experienced it you‚Äôll often think ‚ÄúOh, I remember that‚Äù, however more often than not you are just ‚Äúrecognizing‚Äù the information. If the teacher had asked you beforehand to recall the information you probably would not have been able to do so. Often students (my self included) will see information in the textbook or in an presentation and think ‚Äùoh I remember this, I don‚Äôt need study it‚Äù, and drop that part from their repetitions. This again causes that particular part of the topic unnoticed and you'll not remember it during your exam. Be vigilant. This is also why you should only as a last resort look at your book or the back of a flashcard to "jog" your memory. You'll just go down the path of not actually practicing the information. Which will in turn make you do worse on your exams.

## On the correct study technique
(As I recall and recommend it)

#### 1 Spaced Repetition 
Spaced repetition is the most important step. As you are presented information for the first time you will forget it quite quickly, however if you are reminded of it soon after being presented with the information you will forget it a bit slower. This is a pretty good illustration:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Taakefyrsten/Einar-s-Resource-Blog/main/images/forgetting_curve.png" width="600" height="500"> [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve)


As you can see we have limited time to repeat the information before we have to start at the beginning again. And this is how most study systems break down. They do not take this curve into account, and we need to structure our work to fight this curve. So, does there exist a system where we can prioritize the information that we are likely to be forgetting, or that are ‚Äúin the danger-zone‚Äù? 

Thankfully yes, [Anki üîó](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a tool that really has prioritized this. In it‚Äôs unexpanded form it is simply an advanced flash card app. The genius of it‚Äôs design is the ‚ÄúSuperMemo algorithm‚Äù. It takes in how easy you thought it was to recall the information and how long ago it was since you were last asked to recall it, and figures out how long it should wait to show you the card again. This is why Anki, or really any app with this functionality, is just way better than traditional memorization techniques. 

This (and active recall ‚¨áÔ∏è) is my most important tip. There are two conclusions you should take from this:
1. You **cannot** learn everything in one go. 
2. You **need** to repeat things. Several times. Over several days, if not months.

What I'm saying is this: You need to space out your repetitions. Like working out, you can't just go to the gym and lift weights until you're strong. You need rest; you need air; just like you need to let your body rebuild your muscles, you'll need to let your brain relax between sessions so it can build strong neuron connections.

#### 2 Active Recall 
When you're studying **"recall"** is your most important tool. "Recall" is simply this: Remeber something without looking it up. Recalling information literally builds the connections in your brain. Think of it like this: The first person who walks over a grass field leaves little impact, but with every trip there slowly appears a path. Every time you recall a piece of information the path in your brain becomes little bit stronger. Luckily it will take a lot less work to build these connections in your brain than a [desire path üîó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path).

So how do we do this efficiently? Again [Anki üîó](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is the solution. You simply put together a set of cards that will prompt you to recall the information that needs to be memorized. "Recall" that's the name of the game. This also stops you from just "recognizing" the information, when you're rereading something.

#### 3 Difficulty 
Now that you have an idea about how you should be learning information you‚Äôll want to hone in on the idea of ‚Äúideal difficulty‚Äù. Ideally every time you are asked a question you‚Äôll be able to remember the information, but it needs to be slightly difficult to do so. This, again, makes the paths in your brain stronger. It‚Äôs like dragging a heavy stone along a path to really define it. Use this as your guide as you are making cards, and if your cards become to easy make more difficult cards and if you are struggling with a certain card break down the information into smaller pieces and make easier cards.

#### 4 Elaborating  
When you have become comfortable with the material you are learning you should be expanding your scope. Whenever you get a prompt to recall something you should try to elaborate a little bit more. Let‚Äôs say the question is ‚ÄúWhat is a Pizza‚Äù and the normal answer is ‚ÄúA round bread based dinner food‚Äù you should in addition to try to recall a bit more information like ‚ÄúCommon ingredients are tomatoes and cheese‚Äù and/or ‚ÄúNeapolitan pizza is a internationally recognized TSG product protected in the EU and UK and is listed on UNESCO‚Äôs list of intangible cultural heritage‚Äù if you are getting really advanced. Now you‚Äôre not only making the singular road better but you are connecting it to the network of differing ideas, really cementing it in your brain. As you practice this you‚Äôll get better at it, and it will help you in almost every part of your life.

## On exams and other assessments
Having your teachers and/or examinators assessing your performance is incredibly stressful, and the only real way to lessen that stress, at least a bit, is to be well prepared. However, not all exams are created equal, so how you work towards an exam should be dependent on the style of said exam. An oral exam is, fundamentally, different from a multiple choice exam. Knowing this how do we prepare? Well how do we train for anything else? By doing it. But, as we can't just do the exam many times we need to *simulate* doing the exam. Simulating here means practicing on similar tasks such as practice/previous exams (written exams), answering open ended questions related to the topic with class mates (oral exams), and practicing recalling the information (both). 

Math and chemistry subjects, where you need to solve difficult problems, can seem like the outlier here, but really, they are also the same. Anyone who've done any amout of practice in these topics will tell you it's all about doing practice questions. Why are we doing practice questions? Well, *really*, we're still *just* doing spaced repetition and active recall, but on the rules of problem solving. Often there'll be a set of practice questions related to a course, and you should use these to learn the topic, **but** you need to savour them! You should only do a few at a time, this ensures that you can *space* out your repetition. Remember we're figthing the curve, and if you do not have novel problems to practice on for later sessions you'll have less fun and get less out of doing the practice questions.
