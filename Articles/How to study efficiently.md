# How to study efficiently
To be a good student is *not* to be the student spending the most amount of time on studying. Looking beyond being a kind and social person who is active in class, being a good student is about getting the most out of your courses. You should be gaining skills and learning useful information, and you should try to do your best on your assesments. I hope that with this guide you'll not only do better on your exams and so on, but that you'll have more time to do the things in life that matter, besides school.

## Common pitfalls:
Let's start here, by removing common mistakes that might be holding you back.
### On ‚ÄúLearning styles‚Äù
**There is no evidence that learning styles exist.** After several decades of studies there are stil no evidence for learning styles. It‚Äôs been the consensus since 2006, almost 20 years. I‚Äôm sorry people have been wasting your time with it. It does not make it easier to learn and remember things, *actually* it just pigeonholes and handicaps the students who focus on it. You‚Äôll always end up with a worse study technique. If you focus on good study techniques will you not only learn and remember way more, but you'll spend less time doing so. Again a perfect student spends just the right amount of time on studying, and spends the rest of their time partying, resting and living good lives.

### On remembering vs recognizing
The most common way to burn yourself while repeating information is the pitfall between memory and recognition. When you are presented with information you‚Äôve previously experienced it you‚Äôll often think ‚ÄúOh, I remember that‚Äù, however more often than not you are just ‚Äúrecognizing‚Äù the information. If the teacher had asked you beforehand to recall the information you probably would not have been able to do so. Often students (my self included) will see information in the textbook or in an presentation and think ‚Äùoh I remember this, I don‚Äôt need study it‚Äù, and drop that part from their repetitions. This again causes that particular part of the topic unnoticed and you'll not remember it during your exam. Be vigilant. This is also why you should only as a last resort look at your book or the back of a flashcard to "jog" your memory. You'll just go down the path of not actually practicing the information. Which will in turn make you do worse on your exams.

## On the correct study technique
(As I recall and recommend it)

#### 1 Spaced Repetition 
Spaced repetition is the most important step. As you are presented information for the first time you will forget it quite quickly, however if you are reminded of it soon after being presented with the information you will forget it a bit slower. This is a pretty good illustration:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Taakefyrsten/Einar-s-Resource-Blog/main/images/forgetting_curve.png" width="600" height="500"> [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve)


As you can see we have limited time to repeat the information before we have to start at the beginning again. And this is how most study systems break down. They do not take this curve into account, and we need to structure our work to fight this curve. So, does there exist a system where we can prioritize the information that we are likely to be forgetting, or that are ‚Äúin the danger-zone‚Äù? 

Thankfully yes, [Anki üîó](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a tool that really has prioritized this. In it‚Äôs unexpanded form it is simply an advanced flash card app. The genius of it‚Äôs design is the ‚ÄúSuperMemo algorithm‚Äù. It takes in how easy you thought it was to recall the information and how long ago it was since you were last asked to recall it, and figures out how long it should wait to show you the card again. This is why Anki, or really any app with this functionality, is just way better than traditional memorization techniques. 

This (and active recall ‚¨áÔ∏è) is my most important tip. There are two conclusions you should take from this:
1. You **cannot** learn everything in one go. 
2. You **need** to repeat things. Several times. Over several days, if not months.

What I'm saying is this: You need to space out your repetitions. Like working out, you can't just go to the gym and lift weights until you're strong. You need rest; you need air; just like you need to let your body rebuild your muscles, you'll need to let your brain relax between sessions so it can build strong neuron connections.

#### 2 Active Recall 
When you're studying **"recall"** is your most important tool. "Recall" is simply this: Remeber something without looking it up. Recalling information literally builds the connections in your brain. Think of it like this: The first person who walks over a grass field leaves little impact, but with every trip there slowly appears a path. Every time you recall a piece of information the path in your brain becomes little bit stronger. Luckily it will take a lot less work to build these connections in your brain than a [desire path üîó](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path).

So how do we do this efficiently? Again [Anki üîó](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is the solution. You simply put together a set of cards that will prompt you to recall the information that needs to be memorized. "Recall" that's the name of the game. This also stops you from just "recognizing" the information, when you're rereading something.

#### 3 Difficulty 
Now that you have an idea about how you should be learning information you‚Äôll want to hone in on the idea of ‚Äúideal difficulty‚Äù. Ideally every time you are asked a question you‚Äôll be able to remember the information, but it needs to be slightly difficult to do so. This, again, makes the paths in your brain stronger. It‚Äôs like dragging a heavy stone along a path to really define it. Use this as your guide as you are making cards, and if your cards become to easy make more difficult cards and if you are struggling with a certain card break down the information into smaller pieces and make easier cards.

#### 4 Elaborating  
When you have become comfortable with the material you are learning you should be expanding your scope. Whenever you get a prompt to recall something you should try to elaborate a little bit more. Let‚Äôs say the question is ‚ÄúWhat is a Pizza‚Äù and the normal answer is ‚ÄúA round bread based dinner food‚Äù you should in addition to try to recall a bit more information like ‚ÄúCommon ingredients are tomatoes and cheese‚Äù and/or ‚ÄúNeapolitan pizza is a internationally recognized TSG product protected in the EU and UK and is listed on UNESCO‚Äôs list of intangible cultural heritage‚Äù if you are getting really advanced. Now you‚Äôre not only making the singular road better but you are connecting it to the network of differing ideas, really cementing it in your brain. As you practice this you‚Äôll get better at it, and it will help you in almost every part of your life.

## On exams and other assessments
Having your teachers and/or examinators assessing your performance is incredibly stressful, and the only real way to lessen that stress, at least a bit, is to be well prepared. However, not all exams are created equal, so how you work towards an exam should be dependent on the style of said exam. An oral exam is, fundamentally, different from a multiple choice exam. Knowing this how do we prepare? Well how do we train for anything else? By doing it. But, as we can't just do the exam many times we need to *simulate* doing the exam. Simulating here means practicing on similar tasks such as practice/previous exams (written exams), answering open ended questions related to the topic with class mates (oral exams), and practicing recalling the information (both). 

Math and chemistry subjects, where you need to solve difficult problems, can seem like the outlier here, but really, they are also the same. Anyone who've done any amount of practice in these topics will tell you it's all about doing practice questions. Why are we doing practice questions? Well, *really*, we're still *just* doing spaced repetition and active recall, but on the rules of problem solving. Often there'll be a set of practice questions related to a course, and you should use these to learn the topic, **but** you need to savour them! You should only do a few at a time, this ensures that you can *space* out your repetition. Remember we're fighting the curve, and if you do not have novel problems to practice on for later sessions you'll have less fun and get less out of doing the practice questions. 

## On the perfect student
Now that you‚Äôre totally sold on my ideas on studying. You might be asking: ‚ÄúOh great prophet of studying, how shalt I live my life?‚Äù. And I‚Äôd start with saying that you shouldn‚Äôt keep anyone at such high regard. But I do have some suggestions. ‚ÄúThe Perfect Student‚Äù is not a suggestion of how to live your life. Your life: the social aspects of studying, your friends, your family, any partners you have, these things should take priority. But, if you‚Äôre planning out you schedule for studying I do have some tips.

### 0) The lecture
I think we should start with lectures, the backbone of most academic institutions. [I have a set of ideas about exactly how you should take notes during lectures üîó.](https://github.com/Taakefyrsten/Einar-s-Resource-Blog/blob/main/Articles/On%20Notetaking.md#on-what-to-do-during-lectures) But this will be a bit more of a general set-up. Some lectures you *should* prepare for, usually the lecturer will tell you, but if you are struggling with keeping up with the presentation it‚Äôs a good idea to just skim the topic the before you get to the lecture. Luckily, I think this will mostly be unnecessary.

During the lecture the focus should be on the presenter. [You might want to highlight a PDF version of the PowerPoint in Zotero or on an iPad](https://github.com/Taakefyrsten/Einar-s-Resource-Blog/blob/main/Articles/On%20Notetaking.md#on-what-to-do-during-lectures), but really the most important part is to listen and try to understand what the presenter has to say.

### 1) Brain-dumps
After the presentation I suggest you sit down and do a ‚ÄúBrain-Dump‚Äù of what you remember from the class. Just sit down somewhere somewhat quiet and build out a bullet list or a mind-map. I‚Äôd suggest you try the bullet list first as in my experience it can be difficult to quickly fill in a large amount of information in a mindmap. What is a bullet list? It‚Äôs just this:

- a list
- with points
	- that can be hierarchically structured
	- so you can categorize points under 
		- other points
			- often
				- I‚Äôll go as far as 5 points in
				- but more than this often becomes a bit difficult to keep track of.
		- But as you might realise
	- it‚Äôs very easy process to make these in a document or text editor on your computer.
- This is why I suggest using these, simply the speed and ease of creating one. 


This shouldn‚Äôt really take more than 5-15 minutes, depending on how thorough you want to be. And if you have to get to another class or can‚Äôt do it immediately: don‚Äôt worry. Just do it within the day you had the lecture, I often did it immediately after coming home. 

### 2) Break
Now I suggest you take a well deserved break. I suggest you get some food or snacks into your system, some water and get to talking with some of your fellow students. Getting together after class to chat is IMO a really important part of the student life. You are likely to have common interest and socializing is a good in of itself. Take care of the relationships you are building here, they can be really meaningful.

### 3) Discussion
Now, with the vigor of a person whose just eaten, socialized and had some water, I suggest you find someone in your class to discuss the topics with. If you‚Äôre lucky enough to find a study-group that wants to make this kind of discussions a practice you‚Äôre in luck, not only will this help you but also your fellow students. You can fill each other in on things you didn‚Äôt really get, and you can discuss the finer points of what was presented in the lecture. You might get a few things to add to your brain-dump and you‚Äôll get different perspectives from the different people you surround yourself with.

### 4) Boiling it down
Later in the day, when you‚Äôre working alone and in an comfortable spot you should take the brain-dump and the lecturers presentation and make [Anki flash-cards] out of them. If you are successfully make these after every lecture you‚Äôre basically making sure that all you need to do before the exam is train on practice exams, do practice questions and work through your Anki cards. 

#### Making Anki cards
But how do we make these Anki cards? I suggest you take a look at a few youtube videos about what settings are good for Anki, what the keyboard-shortcuts are like and how to make good cards. It‚Äôs just a topic where a video will help you a lot more text. However I do have a couple of suggestions:

A) Use and abuse cloze cards. These cards simply let you insert a set of text and ‚Äúcloze‚Äù-out parts of the definition 

> [!TIP]
> EXAMPLE:
> 
> *Question*: Pizza is a XXXXXX dinner food
> 
> *Answer*: Pizza is a **round** dinner food.

These cards allow you to also have more than one ‚Äúcloze‚Äù. They make it way easier to break down more difficult topics into bite sized portions.

B) [Look at the available add-ons.](https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons?search=&sort=rating) Personally always suggest
- [Image occlusion add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1374772155)
	- Adds the ability to make cloze cards out of images. This allows you to study life cycles, important figures and so on 
- [Review Heatmap](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1771074083)
	- Adds a simple graph to Anki app that shows how much you‚Äôve studied over the last. This is often a great motivator. Keep it green, as ecologists and ‚Ä¶ other enthusiasts like to say

As you use Anki you‚Äôll find your pain-points with app, and you‚Äôll be able to fix a lot of them by googling the issue and finding a add-on someone has made for that exact issue. 

C) You can and should share your Anki decks; but do so with caution. Not because it gives others an advantage, but rather that it‚Äôs very easy to end up not making the decks yourself. The process of making the cards are an important part of the process. You‚Äôre reviewing the information of the class, which is important. But if you‚Äôre short on time distributing the work with classmates that make decks as good as yours can be a good time saving strategy, just remeber to do so sparingly. 

### 5) Daily practice
Now that you‚Äôre got all of these great materials comes the slog. You need to practice a little every day. Anki makes this easy. When you‚Äôre building your deck you‚Äôll see the cards it recommends you do that day. If you do empty the your daily stack every day, you‚Äôll probably have an easy time with any multiple choice or written exam. Just remember to make some really difficult cards, I‚Äôve often used previous exam questions for this. This is so you don‚Äôt get shocked when you get to the exam.

If you‚Äôre doing math-adjecent subjects, do a few problems every day. This will help keep you motivated, by building your skills and by letting you ‚Äúkeep the streak‚Äù as one would say. 

Whatever skill you are building you should try to practice it often. This is also true about school subjects.

### 6) Take the weekend off
Proper breaks are important. I usually have 17:00 on Fridays to 07:00 on Mondays off. Your break does not need to be during the weekend, but it makes it a bit easier to hang out with friends and so on. There are several examples of people doing a so-called ‚Äúsplit‚Äù-weekend, where they take off Wednesdays (or another weekday) off for themselves, to be alone, and Saturdays off to spend time with family and friends. Just make sure you create a good balance of work and relaxation.
