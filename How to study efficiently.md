# How to study efficiently
To be a good student is *not* to be the student spending the most amount of time on studying. Looking beyond being a kind and social person who is active in class, being a good student is about getting the most out of your courses. You should be gaining skills and learning useful information, and you should try to do your best on your assesments. 

## Common pitfalls:
### On “Learning styles”
**There is no evidence that learning styles exist.** After several  decades of studies there are stil no evidence for learning styles. It’s been the consensus since 2006, almost 20 years. I’m sorry people have been wasting your time with it. It does not make it easier to learn and remember things, *actually* it just pigeonholes and handicaps the students who focus on it. You’ll always end up with a worse study technique. If you focus on good study techniques will you not only .

### On remembering vs recognition
The most common way to burn yourself on repeating information is the pitfall between memory and recognition. When you are presented with information you’ve previously experienced it you’ll often think “Oh, I remember that”, however more often than not you are just “recognizing” the information. If the teacher had asked you beforehand to recall the information you probably would not have been able to do so. Often students (my self included) will see information in the textbook or in an presentation and think ”oh I remember this, I don’t need study it”, and drop 

## On the correct study technique
(As I recall and recommend it)

#### 1 Spaced Repetition 
Spaced repetition is the most important step. As you are presented information for the first time you will forget it quite quickly, however if you are reminded of it soon after being presented with the information you will forget it a bit slower. This is a pretty good illustration:
![[the-forgetting-curve-1536x1240.avif|500]]

As you can see we have limited time to repeat the information before we have to start at the beginning again. And this is how most study systems break down. They do not take this curve into account. So, does there exist a system where we can prioritize the information that we are likely to be forgetting, or as I like to call it “in the danger-zone”? 

Thankfully yes, Anki🟥🔗 is a tool that really has prioritized this. In it’s unexpanded form it is simply an advanced flash card app. The genius of it’s design is the “SuperMemo algorithm”. It uses a both how easy you think it was to recall the information and how long ago it was since you were last asked to recall it, and figures out how long until it should show you the card again. This is why Anki, or really any app with this functionality, is just way better than traditional memorization techniques. 

#### 2 Active Recall 
Being prompted and recalling information literally builds connections in your brain. Think of it like this: The first person who walks over a grass field leaves little impact, but with every trip there slowly appears a path. Every time you recall a piece of information the path your brain takes to deliver it to you becomes little bit stronger. Luckily it’s will take a lot less work to build these connections in your brain than a [desire path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path).

So how do we do this efficiently? Again Anki🟥🔗 is the solution. You simply put together a set of cards that will prompt you to recall the information that needs to be memorized. 

#### 3 Difficulty 
Now that you have an idea about how you should be learning information you’ll want to hone in on the idea of “ideal difficulty”. Ideally every time you are asked a question you’ll be able to remember the information, but it needs to be slightly difficult to do so. This, again, makes the paths in your brain stronger. It’s like dragging a heavy stone along a path to really define it. Use this as your guide as you are making cards, and if your cards become to easy make more difficult cards and if you are struggling with a certain card break down the information into smaller pieces and make easier cards.

#### 4 Elaborating  
When you have become comfortable with the material you are learning you should be expanding your scope. Whenever you get a prompt to recall something you should try to elaborate a little bit more. Let’s say the question is “What is a Pizza” and the normal answer is “A round bread based dinner food” you should in addition to try to recall a bit more information like “Common ingredients are tomatoes and cheese” and/or “Neapolitan pizza is a internationally recognized TSG product protected in the EU and UK and is listed on UNESCO’s list of intangible cultural heritage” if you are getting really advanced. Now you’re not only making the singular road better but you are connecting it to the network of differing ideas, really cementing it in your brain. As you practice this you’ll get better at it, and it will help you in almost every part of your life.


## On exams and other assessments
Having your teachers and/or examinators assessing your performance is incredibly stressful.
