# Computer Tools
If you dislike certain tools here there is always [AlternativeTo 🔗](https://alternativeto.net/), where people review and discuss their preferences for different tools and suggest replacements.

Additonally I want to preface this: Many of the tools I suggest are very adaptable, and for my personal use I've heavily modified them, but I've not included my "builds" of these systems. Why? Because I think the step of customizing them to your tastes is important. In such a process you will neccesarily reflect upon what you want and need out of your tool. Making your tools more comfortable and productive, like a woodworker tuning the handle and blade of a saw, will give you a *much* better tool in the end. One that will make you more productive. I do however also suggest that you have a look at what are popular modifications as inspiration, you do not need to reinvent the wheel, just modify it for the terrain that is your brain.

## Notetaking software
As of January 2024 I think that there are really only two options for notes: **Obsidian & Notion** (well for 99% of people at least). I have a strong preference for Obsidian as your files are stored locally and you have endless customization of the editor. It’s also based on markdown, a small and open file format, so if you need to drop Obsidian you'll still have all of your notes.

However, there are people who absolutely love Notion, and find the way it operates more satisfying. This is simply the case of peoples needs being different. If you are working in team some of Notions features can be extremely useful.

In either case, if working with information is an important step in your work you should spend some time thinking about how and why you are taking notes. I do have a lot of thoughts on this topic 🟥🔗

## Citation software / Source manager & reader
Zotero, my love, my rock, my compatriot. There is no tool that I find easier to recommend than Zotero. If you need to cite more than a few things, I recommend Zotero; if you have more than a couple of PDFs that you need to keep control over, I recommend Zotero; if you are highlighting and rereading these highlights in a digital document, I recommend Zotero; if you are going to reread a highlight in a document more than a couple of times, I recommend Zotero. 

Adding new sources to the Zotero library can be as easy as just clicking the browser add-on on a given website, and boom you can cite it correctly. It’s the easiest, the most reliable and the best developed citation software out there.

If you, like me, like to hoard sources so you easily find them again at a later date Zotero is your savior. I love being able to go back to a power-point from a course I had 2-3 years ago to find a piece of information not easily found on the internet. I love being able to highlight text in a epub or pdf and just exporting them into my Obsidian vault when I’m writing my notes about the text.

Zotero is, in my book, a must have for all students and academics, and really anyone who relies on revisiting texts.

##  Research aids
[Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/) is a website that let’s you explore the relationships between scientific articles. If you are in the exploratory phase of writing a text that relies on such articles you research rabbit can give you a great deal of utility. Especially for finding the most “important” articles in the vicinity of the articles in your collection. It also integrates with zotero ❤️.

In addition I suggest [Texas A&M University Libraries excellent post 🔗](https://tamu.libguides.com/c.php?g=1289555) on AI based research aids. To me it’s been a great tool to ignore the chaff of terrible LLM-tools and just go use the good ones. Here’s to you TAMU 🍻.
